=== Background

This Rails plugin allows you to execute code blocks in a background task with a very intuitive and easy syntax.
It is as easy as that:

   background do
     # do some time-consuming task
   end

Refer to the Kernel#background documentation for details.

=== Dependencies

There are no dependencies besides ActiveSupport, which is required by Rails anyways.

=== Credits

This plugin uses the proc_source.rb file by Florian Gro, found here:

=== Installation

Just copy the background folder into vendor/plugins, and you're good to go.
